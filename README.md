The meanest realtime task tracker
=============================
### You wouldn't like your app to be called "Todo app", right :) 

### Using:
Angular, SockJS, Primus, Express, Node, Mongoose

## Installation
 - install MongoDB and start it (on default port, 27017)
 - git clone this repo
 - do `npm install` from the project's root
 - do `bower install` from the `public` folder
 - start server from the project's root with `node server.js`
 - open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (don't use IE)
 
## Still to do:
 - drag and drop tasks to reorder them (inside the category)
 - add label with task counter for each category (Active, On hold, Complete)
 
## Detailed post follows
I'll soon write a post describing, step by step, how to put this together from the ground up.
